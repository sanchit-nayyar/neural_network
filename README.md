# Neural Network

This project contains the code of a basic 3 layer Artificial Neural Network written in Python from scratch. The purpose of this project was to understand in detail how a neural network works and how the various parameters associated with it are calculated.

### Prerequisites

Since the code has been written from scratch, the only prerequisite is...

```
Python
```

### Execution

```
python2 test.py
```
